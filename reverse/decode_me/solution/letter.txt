Dear participant,

Congrats on getting this far, It's really satisfying to see people getting good technical skills.

This challenge was easy, wasn't it? but you still managed to learn one new thing or two, this is typically my goal from every challenge I implement for CTF contests, there is no point in implementing a crackme in Rust and adding packers like Themida or VMProtect, it makes the challenge hard, but not necessarily of good quality.

Oh and I forgot, here is your flag: shellmates{x86_has_WA4AY_Too_M4nY_IN$TRUC710N$}

Best,
Redouane
